        NOTE TO MAINTAINERS:
        This page  is only there as an emergency fallback incase apache (or similar) is not intercepting rewrites to `./index.html.php`.
        It contains no metadata, as it cannot import the metadata partials via php.

            If you can see this for more than a few seconds something has gone wrong; your browser probably has <u>javascript disabled</u>.
            <br>
            You should probably look up how to fix that but you can also click <a href="./program.html.php">this link</a> to manually visit the main RTN page.
