Rapid Tree Notetaker
	What is this?
		The Rapid Tree Notetaker (RTN) is a notetaking tool developed by computer science student Brendan Rood at the University of Minnesota Duluth.
		It aims to provide an easy way to take notes formatted similar to a Reddit thread, with indentation following a tree-like structure allowing for grouping.
		It also prioritizes ease of sharing, as the URL can be shared to instantly communicate the note's contents.
			Notice how the border is flashing?
			Every time you see that, it means that the document has been saved to the URL!
			If the URL ever becomes longer than 8192 characters, it will alert you that saving is no longer possible.
			You can click the header of the page to save the document as a `.rtn` file.
		It is free to use and will never ask you to log in.
